# CppRevisitit
A compilation of small coding exercises to revisit and polish my skills in C++. 
A basic understanding of OOP is expected to be able to follow the examples, but I generally like to write quite explicit and extensive comments to reinforce my own learning and in order to effortlesly be able to look back and reapply what I did.
This might help whoever decides to try these exercises out for themselves.
